# About Me

This is the personal blog of Hermann Loose.

I'm [this guy](https://github.com/hermannloose), [this
guy](https://twitter.com/hermannloose) and also [this
guy](https://facebook.com/hermannloose). Further, [this
guy](https://plus.google.com/u/0/107980417360832836385/posts).

*Burn And Tremble* is a song title by *A Subtle Plague* that I happen to like
a lot (and found to be available as a domain).  You've probably **literally**
never heard of them, at least not on the web, which is why I'm quite happy
someone put [this gem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H47HrF0a2_o#t=0m15s) up.

### GPG
My public key is [A4A7CDEB](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x1DBAC963A4A7CDEB).

Don't expect me to sign most of my mail by default though, as I normally use
GMail's web interface. Same goes for reading—Android involved here—so maybe
give me a heads-up before sending lots of encrypted mail my way.
