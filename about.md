# About Me

I'm [this guy](https://github.com/hermannloose), [this
guy](https://twitter.com/hermannloose) and also [this
guy](https://facebook.com/hermannloose). Further, [this
guy](https://plus.google.com/u/0/107980417360832836385/posts).

### GPG
My public key is [A4A7CDEB](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x1DBAC963A4A7CDEB).

Don't expect me to sign most of my mail by default though, as I normally use
GMail's web interface. Same goes for reading—Android involved here—so maybe
give me a heads-up before sending lots of encrypted mail my way.
