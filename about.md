# About Me

This is the personal blog of Hermann Loose.

I'd like to see myself [write code](https://github.com/hermannloose) more
often, right now there's just a lot of cramming in order to finish my degree
plus the unfortunate temptations of [the](https://twitter.com/hermannloose)
[usual](https://facebook.com/hermannloose)
[suspects](https://plus.google.com/u/0/107980417360832836385/posts).

I sometimes [take photos](http://500px.com/hermannloose) of things and have in
one or two occasions been caught [running
around](http://runkeeper.com/user/hermannloose) for no apparent reason.

Humans may contact me using

### GPG

My public key is
[A4A7CDEB](http://keys.gnupg.net:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x1DBAC963A4A7CDEB).

I highly encourage you to make the effort and encrypt *all* mail you send my
way, since none of it is the legitimate business of the NSA, GCHQ, or others.

### How did the title come about?

*Burn And Tremble* is a song title by *A Subtle Plague* that I happen to like
a lot and found to be available as a domain. You've probably **literally**
never heard of them, at least not on the web, which is why I'm quite happy
someone put [this gem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H47HrF0a2_o#t=0m15s) up.
