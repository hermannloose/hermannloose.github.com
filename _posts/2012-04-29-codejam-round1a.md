*In which the hero completely failed to place. Like, anywhere.*

Beware of the sour grapes below!

So I woke up at 2.30am CEST, after about four hours of sleep. Not a complete
zombie but still my eyes wouldn't properly focus. Asked myself again why
exactly I was doing this. Got out of bed, made tea, sat down in front of the
machine in stylish 80s GDR bathrobe—feeling a bit Arthur Dent at this
point—totally not ready to do any heavy mental lifting.

3am rolls around, the round starts. I read through Problem A, after about ten
seconds I think *ZOMG, floating pointsez!!1!* (the familiar *panic!* part)
further *I'll completely mess up if I start with this* (the *it's 3am,
I should've known better*-part) and decide to instead work on Problem B, which
sounds reasonable.

I hack until about 40 minutes into the round, which by itself is already quite
unimpressive. I then fire up the algorithm for the first time and get precisely
**zero** output. *Why, I'm loving this!* One or two grave errors jump at me,
I make some corrections to those parts, add some debug output—*I should really
learn to use a command-line debugger efficiently*—and still loop like I got
nothing better to do.

Realizing that I'm starting to thoroughly mess up my approach to the whole
thing I decide to check the scoreboard. Something close to 1700 and very
obviously not improving. So, choose your own adventure? Carry on, yay/noez?

1. You go to bed at 5.30am.

   You wake up totally knackered, having lost 20 health. *Roll the D10.* You
   will lose as many points of your ability to concentrate over the next 24
   turns. *Roll the D10 again.* If it's less than eight, you will not gain
   points for problem solving.

   Also, definitely no cigar.

2. You throw in the towel.

   You gain +100 on your ability of *being a quitterWELLSOMETIMES*. You wake up
   semi-refreshed. Add *Potion of Self-Deception* and *The Excuse of Having
   Loads of Other Goals™* to your inventory. The One Who Pushed On provides +5
   encouraging words. ([No,
   really.](https://plus.google.com/107980417360832836385/posts/WqpT1fD4M2M))

   You didn't really want that cigar, right?

## Conclusion ##

I'll try again in Round 1C, as an upcoming Golden Jubilee conveniently keeps me
from competing in Round 1B. I will probably be facing the same situation, but
with the contest starting at 11am rather than in the middle of the night, I see
myself taking the time to hang in there, even if I clearly won't make the cut
from early on.
