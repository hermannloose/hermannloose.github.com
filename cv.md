## Expertise ##

I don't sleep well in the absence of green tests and the word code review
gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling. I'm no stranger to agile methodology.

My NERF marksmanship is average.

### Languages ###

**Ruby**, **Java**, **C** – for stuff I did prior to my current internship.

I'm probably most productive in Java.

**C++** – which I write a lot like Java, maybe not brutally efficient.

Things I've used / dabbled in / *"heard of"* a while ago—*and definitely can't
do on the spot without revisiting*—include Python, Lua, Haskell, Erlang,
Prolog, in roughly that order. I'm still looking for a project to try out
Clojure and Scala.

If the language you throw at me isn't butt-ugly, I'll likely pick it up fast.

Lastly, native **German**, fluent **English**, basic **French**.
